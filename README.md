**EV Charging Station Route Optimizer**

This Python-based application uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a given starting location to the nearest electric vehicle (EV) charging station. It's designed to assist EV users in navigating to charging stations efficiently, contributing to the enhancement of EV infrastructure accessibility.

**Overview**

The EV Charging Station Route Optimizer is designed to assist EV drivers in finding the most efficient path to the nearest charging station from their current location. It leverages a network graph represented in graph_edges.csv, where nodes correspond to intersections or charging stations, and edges represent the roads connecting them.

**Getting Started**
Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
**
Prerequisites**
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

**Installation**
1.	Clone the repository:
     git clone https://github.com/gondal10/Final-Project-INFR2820.git
2.	Ensure that the graph_edges.csv file is located within the same directory as your cloned repository. This CSV file contains the graph data necessary for route optimization.
3.	Run the python script
     python FinalProject.py
